# Year 3 Software Modelling and Design Project
## AI for Autonomous Driving Car Simulation 

made by:
`Therrense Lua (github: ttvs)`
`Tianlei Zheng (github: ztl8702)`

## Specification
- Explore surrounding area (car has memory of explored area and a vision of a few squares around it)
- Collect keys in ascending order before going to finish tile
- While maintaining enough health (health regeneration on ice tiles, health lost on lava tiles)

## Features
- Design & implemented a low-level subsystem to manoeuvre a car with high precision and coordination 
- Used complex heuristics and search algorithms to navigate around convoluted obstacles
